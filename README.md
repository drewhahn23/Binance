Working towards a fully automated training bot that uses machine learning to make decisions.

As of Dec 2021, this repo only contains a couple scripts for data collection using the Binance API. 
It also has a few basic modeling attempts as well as a couple more in depth ones using neural networks
and packages such as LightGBM. 

binance_main.py is a fully operational trading bot. However, some of the parameters are a bit too sensitive at 
current state. Ideally the long term goal is to create a fully operational bot that can adapt to different 
market atmospheres. This will prove challenging, but it is something I enjoy working on.

If you have any ideas for a trading bot or improving this system, feel free to contact me. I can be reached
